# Full Stack Developer Assignment

We’ve setup this assignment with the following goals:

-   Getting to know each other a little better
-   Getting to know your strengths
-   Getting to know your preferences

By conducting an assignment, which is bigger than one can handle in the given time, you are forced to make choices:

-   What do you find most important;
-   What are your ‘go-to’ tasks, etc.

So, don’t worry about finishing all of the work, **that’s not the goal**.

## The assignment

### Prerequisites

Below you’ll find some directions to setup the development environment and project.

1. Setup your development environment;

    - IDE of you choosing
    - PHP 8+
    - Composer
    - Node.JS

2. Checkout the current repository, install the dependencies with the following commands:

    - composer install

### Project details

A Vuejs SPA application has already been set up for you using Laravel, Vuejs, and Laravel Passport.

All Authentication configuration has been provided by Laravel UI.

Since it's a Single Page Application, both Vue Router and Vuex have been installed.

Veux is optional, but it will be considered a big plus if you use it.
